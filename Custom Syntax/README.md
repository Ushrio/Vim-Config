# What is this?

The purpose of this folders and the files within is to provide syntax files
which I find to be better than vim-Polyglot. Take these files and replace the ones
in "./vim/syntax", renaming the old ones as "oldsyntax.vim.bak".
These languages should also be disabled inside of vim polyglot with the
let:g:polyglot_disabled command.
