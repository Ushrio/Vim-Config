# What is this?

The purpose of this folder and the files within is to provide syntax files
which I find to be better than Vim-Polyglot.

## Windows
Take these files and replace the ones
in "./vim/syntax", renaming the old ones as "oldsyntax.vim.bak".

## MacOS
Place these files inside of "~/.vim/after/syntax/". If those folders don't exist
create them.

## General
These languages should also be disabled inside of vim polyglot with the
let:g:polyglot_disabled command. (Vim-Polyglot does not include a Java syntax file)`
