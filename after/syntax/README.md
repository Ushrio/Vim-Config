# What is this?

The purpose of this folder and the files within is to provide syntax files
which I find to be better than Vim-Polyglot.

## Windows
Symlink or place the whole after directory into your "/vimfiles/" directory

## MacOS and Linux
Symlink or place these files inside of "~/.vim/after/syntax/". If those folders don't exist
create them.

## General
These languages should also be disabled inside of vim polyglot with the
let:g:polyglot_disabled command. (Vim-Polyglot does not include a Java syntax file)`
