# Vim-Config
My personal Vim configuration for Windows. Works on MacOS but you have to rename _vimrc to .vimrc and .gvimrc.

1. Install Vim from [here](https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases)
2. Install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) into autoload directory (Follow installation instructions on page)
3. Checkout this repository to Vim directory
4. Start Vim
6. Restart Vim
8. Profit
